Thermodynamic Calculations of Combustion Reactions

This is a little program I made for Combustion reaction calculations. The main goal is to calculate the heat generated by the combustion using thermodynamic relationships. There are a few assumptions:

-Ideal gas behavior of components of the reaction (Water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen)
-Isobaric process

It can:

-Calculate and print on the screen the heat transfer by the combustion reaction between Dry air or humid air a few fuels like Methane, Acetylene, ethane, ethanol, propane, butane
-Calculate and print on screen Dew - Point temperature of the combustion products when air is humid

It will:

-Calculate and print the Adiabatic Flame Temperature
-Include many other reaction components beyond Water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen
-Be useful for include in thermodynamic cycles modeling, instead of using air properties

Messages and comments are in Spanish, my bad, soon I'll translate them into English

I'm open to comments, greetings

By the way, I'm learning to use this platform, sorry for the mistakes if there's any hehe

- The adiabatic flame temperature module was modified and included to the code, it solves the problem using Bisection Method. It depends on the first guess of the adiabatic flame temperature, if the method didn't get convergence, an output message will come out saying "Improve your first guess, convergence was not reached".

- Comments and output messages are still in Spanish :)
