Thermodynamic Calculations of Combustion Reactions

This is a little program I made for Combustion reaction calculations. The main goal is to calculate the heat generated by the combustion using thermodynamic relationships. There are a few assumptions:

-Ideal gas behavior of components of the reaction (Water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen)
-Isobaric process

It can:

-Calculate and print on the screen the heat transfer by the combustion reaction between Dry air or humid air a few fuels like Methane, Acetylene, ethane, ethanol, propane, butane
-Calculate and print on screen Dew - Point temperature of the combustion products when air is humid

It will:

-Calculate and print the Adiabatic Flame Temperature
-Include many other reaction components beyond Water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen
-Be useful for include in thermodynamic cycles modeling, instead of using air properties

Messages and comments are in Spanish, my bad, soon I'll translate them into English

I'm open to comments, greetings

By the way, I'm learning to use this platform, sorry for the mistakes if there's any hehe
